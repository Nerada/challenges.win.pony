Pony Challenge API

Help the pony escape the Domokun!
1. Create your maze API call (dimensions 15 to 25) + valid pony name
2. Get the maze with the ID from 1: you will get pony (player) location, Domokun (monster) location and maze walls
3. Move your pony (until you are dead or you reach the end-point)
(you can also print the maze with the API)
